Search results:

For array size - 20

Search from start of array:
Binary Search recursively - 6100 ns 
Binary Search iteratively - 9400 ns

Search from the middle of array:
Binary Search recursively - 9400 ns 
Binary Search iteratively - 8800 ns

Search from the end of array:
Binary Search recursively - 8600 ns 
Binary Search iteratively - 9100 ns

There is no significant difference in recursive and iterative implementation effectiveness.
Both have O(log n) complexity.
